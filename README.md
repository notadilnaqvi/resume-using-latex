# Resume using LaTeX

[LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) is a document preparation system primerily used in the scientific community for the preperation of papers, journals and other publications

LaTeX outputs beautifully typeset and very high quality documents in comparison to some WYSIWYG word processors like MS Word

## Using the template

You'll need to install a compatible LaTeX distribution (MiKTeX/proTeX/MacTeX) on your machine. See the [official guide](https://www.latex-project.org/get/)

In an empty project folder, run `git clone https://github.com/notadilnaqvi/resume-using-latex.git`

Open `resume.tex` in LaTeX and start editing

Run build to produce `resume.pdf`
